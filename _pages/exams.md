# Midterm Exam Details

Our first and only midterm exam will occur October 24, 2019, at 11a in DMP301.

The exam is worth 15% of your final score in the course.

# Exam Topics and Format

The exam will consist of 6 to 8 problems, each of which will require you to apply
some skill or strategy you have learned in the course. We will expect you to
be able to *produce* code similar to those found in the POTD (and in some cases
perhaps a bit more complex), and to be able to *read* and *debug* more substantial
Python examples. Throughout all, the emphasis will be on problem-solving, and not
on Python syntax. 

A copy of the dataframes cheat-sheet will be provided. No other resources will 
be allowed (or needed). 

Here are the topics...


Classes:

  -	Problem decomposition and design	
  - member variables - default values	
  - member functions - defining/using	

Web Scraping:
  - fill in blank	
  - data assembly	

Data Frames:
  - filtering	
  - projecting columns	
  - functions	

Plotting:
  - we specify a plot, you sketch it	

Voronoi Diagrams:
  - definition	
  - application	

BFS:
  - execution
  - debug implementation	
  - application

Data Structures: List, Dictionary, Queue, Deque

All lectures, labs, POTD, and projects through Friday, October 18, 
contain testable information.
