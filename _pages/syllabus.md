## Course Components

### Class Meetings (5%):

Student active engagement and ongoing feedback is welcomed and expected.

### Projects (4 x 7.5% = 30%):

You will be asked to complete 4 increasingly complex programming
assignments over the course of the semester. Duration of these
projects will be approximately 2 weeks.

### Lab Meetings (10%):

This semester the lab meeting content will be shaped by the programming
projects. They will be a perfect opportunity for students to discuss
design ideas and directions with course staff, and to receive
debugging assistance. Marking will be based on attendance.

### Exams (15% + 25%):

There will be one midterm and one final exam in the course. Midterm
is scheduled for Oct 24, in class. The final exam is scheduled by
the university. We expect to announce its details by Nov 1.

### Problems of the Day (50 x 0.30% = 15%):

We believe that programming fluency comes with regular practice.
To reinforce the concepts we introduce in the classroom, and to build
fluency, we will be assigning short daily exercises for you to
complete. These exercises, referred to as POTD, will likely take
around 15minutes. You will complete the POTD using an online tool
called repl.it, and submit your response to another tool called
Gradescope for very light autograding.

## Reading

We will be suggesting readings from two different interactive Python
texts. Both of them use _turtle graphics_ as a sandbox for learning
how to think about the sequential execution of code. We will not
use turtle graphics for any of our explorations, but you may enjoy
learning about it. Here are the links to the texts:
